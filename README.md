# HetServe-Foundation
> [A Overview of Efficiently Serving Foundation Models across Edge Devices [arXiv] (TBD)]()

## What is This Overview About? 
Foundation models (e.g., large language models and diffusion models) have achieved remarkable results across diverse tasks. However, their resource-intensive characteristics present challenges for efficient deployment. In this overview, we explore the approach of serving them on distributed edge devices, aiming to address concerns regarding scalability and latency. **Unlike existing surveys, our objective is to offer a comprehensive overview of foundation model serving rather than merely focusing on LLM serving.**

## Why Efficiently Serving Foundation Models over Distributed Heterogeneous Devices is Needed?
Efficiently serving foundation models over distributed heterogeneous devices is necessary to provide a seamless user experience with low latency. It enables scalability by leveraging resources from multiple devices, optimizing load balancing and resource utilization. This approach helps manage network congestion by distributing the delivery load across different devices. With the diverse range of device types available, efficient serving ensures that each device receives an optimized stream tailored to its capabilities. Overall, efficiently serving LLMs over distributed heterogeneous devices improves user experience, scalability, network performance, and accommodates the growing variety of devices in use.

### Serving Metrics

- [arXiv 2024.04] [Andes: Defining and Enhancing Quality-of-Experience in LLM-Based Text Streaming Services](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16283) | University of Michigan
#### Common Metrics
- **Time To First Token (TTFT)**: How quickly users start seeing the model's output after entering their query. Low waiting times for a response are essential in real-time interactions, but less important in offline workloads. This metric is driven by the time required to process the prompt and then generate the first output token.
- **Time Per Output Token (TPOT)**: Time to generate an output token for each user that is querying our system. This metric corresponds with how each user will perceive the "speed" of the model. For example, a TPOT of 100 milliseconds/tok would be 10 tokens per second per user, or ~450 words per minute, which is faster than a typical person can read.
- **Latency**: The overall time it takes for the model to generate the full response for a user. Overall response latency can be calculated using the previous two metrics: latency = (TTFT) + (TPOT) * (the number of tokens to be generated).
- **Throughput**: The number of output tokens per second an inference server can generate across all users and requests.
